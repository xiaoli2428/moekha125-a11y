# File to change: .github/workflows/main.yml

# Find these lines (already correct per current file, but double-check for additional jobs in other workflow files!)
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
- uses: actions/cache@v4
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4

# If you see lines like this anywhere in your workflow YAML:
# uses: actions/setup-node@<SHA or old version>
# uses: actions/checkout@<SHA or old version>
# Replace ALL with the stable tag v4:
uses: actions/setup-node@v4
uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Also, ensure the correct with block as below for setup-node:
with:
  node-version: '18'
  cache: 'npm'   # only for "with cache" step

# There are currently no checkout steps in your posted YAML.
# If you need to add checkout (typically before setup-node), insert:
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Full context for your main workflow already contains correct setup-node syntax.
# If you have other workflow files (.github/workflows/[other].yml), repeat for those as needed!
