# Onchainweb — Home page (minimal)

This is a minimal React + Vite + Tailwind starter that reproduces a DeFi-style homepage inspired by the screenshot and ddefi3.com. Project name: Onchainweb.

Quick start:
1. Install dependencies:
   - npm install
2. Run dev server:
   - npm run dev
3. Build:
   - npm run build
4. Preview:
   - npm run preview

Notes:
- The UI uses mock data for balances and markets. I can integrate real price feeds, on-chain data, and wallet connect (MetaMask, WalletConnect, wagmi) on request.
- Branch name to use: add-onchainweb-homepage
- Commit message: "Add Onchainweb homepage"

If you want me to push:
- Create the repo moekha125-a11y under the account xiaoli2428 and invite collaborator "copilot" with Write permission, then tell me and I will push the branch, commit files and open a PR.

If you prefer to push yourself, use the git commands in the README to create the branch and push.
